Stock Analysis for Steve
1.	Overview of Project:
The purpose of the analysis was to research stocks for our client Steve and his parents who are want to check how stocks fared in 2017 and 2018. We needed to show returns for both years and check for trends to make better choices to pick stocks to trade. We also learned how to code more efficiently and improve the overall process for analyzing stock tickers. .

2.  Overall it looks like Steveâ€™s parents had better returns in 2017 than 2018. In 2017 the majority of their stocks fell flat or declined in value but improved significantly in 2018. However, stocker ticker TERP declined further from 2017 to 2018. The refactoring code significantly improved time so it helped Steve get his results faster when running our improved code.

3. Summary:
1.  Advantages with refactoring a code is time efficiency and more time can be spent analyzing the output of the data.  
a. Disadvantages with refactoring code is the time and complexity it takes to writing the code. 
3. Key benefits of refactoring the original VBA script is the following: 
-easy to read and understand for anyone or third party agency or employee
-easy to maintain and less storage space 
-easier to run 

key disadvantages: It took a bit longer to debug/troubleshoot any issues due to complexity of the new code
